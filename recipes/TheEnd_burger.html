        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.</li>
        <li>Add the bacon for about 15 minutes or until it starts to curl and become crispy.</li>
        <li>Divide the minced meat into balls of 150 grams and shape them into hamburgers. <br>Make sure the hamburger is about 1 - 1.5 cm thick. Season well with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place a frying pan over a high heat. Melt a knob of butter in this. Fry the burgers on both sides until they are well done.</li>
        <li>Keep the burgers warm by putting a lid on the pan.</li>
        <li>Break 4 eggs into a large pan so that you get four fried eggs. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>When the bacon is almost ready, place the hamburger buns in the oven with the flat side up. Let them brown slightly and then take them out.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burger: put a layer of cocktail sauce on the bottom half of the buns. <br>Top with a lettuce leaf, 2 tomato slices, a slice of cheddar cheese and then the burger.</li>
        <li>Place another slice of cheddar on the still warm burger.</li>
        <li>Then top with 2-3 bacon strips and a fried egg. Finish with a few pickle slices and season again with pepper.</li>
        <li>Cover with the top half of the rolls, ready to serve! Please, don't forget your sauces.</li>
